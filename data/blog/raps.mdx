[Media corporations today aren't perfect](https://medium.com/@balajis/citations-for-the-recode-handshake-debunking-b2751adc7e69). They make their money from advertising which means they make more money the more content they create. It's hard to maintain quality when revenues are correlated with quantity. Recommendation algorithms are designed to keep us engaged and get better the more we consume. With content generation technologies like [GTP-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) we are on the cusp of an information explosion which will only make things worse. The incentives of the institution and the individual are not aligned.

Media protocols can be designed with different incentives. Advertising models aren't needed when readers pay writers directly. This is starting to happen. Right now I pay $50 a year to consume [Matt Taibbi's content](https://taibbi.substack.com/). This is a good start but there's exists [better technology](https://mintgate.gitbook.io/tpp/) to track the ownership and consumption of Taibbi's content. In this new model we won't follow a publication like the Rolling Stones, we'll follow writers like Taibbi. If you want to be a writer in the future you'll have to be a founder because you won't be able to inherit a publisher's audience. That may sound scary for a writer in search of an audience but the upside of ownership over your own work and audience will make it worth it. That fear exists for every founder starting out.

I experienced the same fear when I started [my first company](https://www.conversify.ai/) last year. I think that if founding and inheriting cost the same we would all choose to be founders. But right now they don't don't cost the same and it's more expensive to be a founder. It requires taking a risk failing and potentially months without an income. There's nothing more addictive than a [monthly salary](https://www.amazon.ca/Nassim-Nicholas-Taleb-addictions-carbohydrates/dp/B0857BR1WN).

Just because better technology exists doesn't mean our institutions will evolve right away. The blockchain requires that we all be founders and the fear that comes with it will be hard to overcome for most. This is will get easy over time. As Balaji points out, founding becomes easier when the cost associated with it decreases. [This cost is decreasing everyday](https://www.navalmanack.com/secret-sections/building-startups). The promise of protocols is that one day we'll all be founders which is just another way of saying that one day we'll all be free.
