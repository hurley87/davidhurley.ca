            &nbsp;I work at intersection of growth, software and AI.

          <p>
            I grew up in small-town Kingston and went to school at Queen's
            University, graduating with a bachelor of science degree (barely). I
            started my tech career in sales before learning how to code. Now I
            build apps that help people grow their business. I spend my free
            time watching the Maple Leafs win with my fiance Hayley and our
            chihuahua, Mikey.
