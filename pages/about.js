            My name is David Hurley and I work at intersection of growth,
            software and AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Kingston and went to school at Queen's University,
            graduating with a bachelor's degree. I started my tech career in
            sales before learning how to code. Now I build apps that help people
            grow their business. I spend my free time watching the Leafs win
            with my fiance Hayley and our chihuahua, Mikey.
